# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohamed Metwally (metwallysec)

I'm a **bug bounty hunter** and **security-focused builder** who enjoys understanding systems deeply — not just breaking them, but improving how they work.

I believe productivity, security, and clarity are connected.  
That’s why I build tools that help me **track time, analyze behavior, and learn consistently**.

## 🧭 My Philosophy
> I don’t try to work more hours.  
> I try to understand **where my hours go**.

I prefer simple systems that stay out of the way and let data speak for itself.
